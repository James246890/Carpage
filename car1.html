<p align="center">This car is called the Inferno Exotic Car, a new super sports car thats coming out in Mexico.<br>
   It has 670 torque, and 1,400 horsepower. An interesting fact is that due to its unique sensor <br>
 chip, it litterally pulls power from the air, meaning you never have to recharge it.</p> <br>
<h1 align ="center">Delorean</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="car2.jpg" alt="Carpage" width="500" height="250"></p>
<p align="center"> This car is the only car you will ever need. <br>
 This stylish vehicle is capable of going up to 90 mph, <br>
 looking fancy, and travelling through time. <br>
Just make sure that you DO NOT disrupt the space-time continuum</p> <br>
 <h1 align ="center">Rusty but Trusty</h1>

 <p align="center">Good ole Mater. He's freindly, loyal, and the best tow truck you'll ever meet. <br>
 A couple of his favorite passtimes iclude driving backwards and riding in helicopters. <br>
 Just make sure you have some patience left in you before talking to him,<br>
 Because if you don't, he will get on your nerves very quickly.</p>
 <h1 align="center">Carpool</h1>
<p align="center"> <img src="car4.jpg" alt="Carpage" width="500" height="250"></p>
 <p align="center">Puts a whole new meaning to the word doesn't it? <br>
 This car is the only car anyone needs on a nice hot day. <br>
Perfect for swimming, cruising, and possible severe injury, <br>
but that last one is only because there is no seat belts.</p>
<h1 align="center">Super Limo</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="car5.jpg" alt="Carpage" width="500" height="250"> </p>
<p align="center">Honestly is there any other way to descibe this monster? <br>
This limo is big, ridiculously big, like a subway train big. <br>
How one could possibly drive this thing safely is beyond me, <br>
but one thing is for certain, if you own one of these beasts, <br>
then you got some serious cash in your pocket.</p>
